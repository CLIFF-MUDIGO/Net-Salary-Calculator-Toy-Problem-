## Project Description
The Net Salary Calculator is a toy problem that involves building a simple program that calculates the net salary of an employee based on their gross salary and tax rate. The program takes two inputs from the user: their gross salary and their tax rate. It then calculates the net salary by subtracting the tax amount from the gross salary. The tax amount is calculated as a percentage of the gross salary. The program then outputs the net salary to the user.
